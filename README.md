# Hi there, I'm Khawar Hasnain! üëã

I am a Data Scientist with the IBM Data Science Professional Certification and deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization. My journey in data science involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data from various real-world sources, then extracting insights through statistical methods, machine learning, and deep learning.

## üèÜ Projects

### Winning Space Race with Data Science (Capstone Project)
Repository: [Winning-Space-Race-with-Data-Science](https://github.com/Malik-Khawar/data-science-capstone)  
In this project, I applied data science skills to analyze SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches. I collected data from multiple sources, performed data wrangling, explored the data using SQL and visualization, and built predictive models to gain insights into launch success factors. The process concluded with a presentation summarizing the analysis steps and findings.

### CO2-emissions-using-Liner-Regression
Repository: [CO2-emissions-using-Liner-Regression](https://github.com/Malik-Khawar/CO2-emissions-using-Liner-Regression)  
Purposed for studying global CO‚ÇÇ emissions, this project:
- Demonstrates data preprocessing and cleansing steps.  
- Implements linear regression to predict emissions and identify significant variables.  
- Utilizes statistical analysis to measure model performance and refine it with relevant feature engineering.

### Credit-Card-Fraud
Repository: [Credit-Card-Fraud](https://github.com/Malik-Khawar/Credit-Card-Fraud)  
Built for detecting fraudulent transactions within credit card data. This project explores:
- A variety of classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).  
- Techniques for handling highly imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE).  
- Performance metrics such as confusion matrix, F1 score, and ROC curves.

### K-Nearest-Customer-Segmentation
Repository: [K-Nearest-Customer-Segmentation](https://github.com/Malik-Khawar/K-Nearest-Customer-Segmentation)  
Focused on customer segmentation and marketing strategies, it involves:
- Data wrangling and exploratory analysis of customer attributes.  
- K-Nearest Neighbors approach to cluster or classify customers into distinguishable groups.  
- Strategies to refine the model‚Äôs accuracy and enhance insight generation.

### Music-Genre-Classification-Using-DL
Repository: [Music-Genre-Classification-Using-DL](https://github.com/Malik-Khawar/Music-Genre-Classification-Using-DL)  
An application of deep learning techniques for audio data, covering:
- Feature extraction from music files using spectrograms and MFCCs.  
- Building and training neural network architectures for high accuracy.  
- Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, and F1 metrics.
